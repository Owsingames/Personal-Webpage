                    <p class="p-center">Programing holds a special place in my heart because the skill came to me when I was completely unsure of my direction in life. Programming helped provide bring me peace and focus from the surrounding chaos while being engaging and fun. I started learning programing around the age of 25 and I have a wide range of technical skills including Microsoft Azure, SQL/SSMS, APIs, and OOP/MVC. I am proud to call myself a Full-Stack C#/.NET engineer and Web developer.</p>
